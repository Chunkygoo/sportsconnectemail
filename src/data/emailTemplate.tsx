export const emailTemplate = `Hi Coach COACH_NAME,
 
Kindly allow me to introduce myself! I am Tracy Guo (https://www.linkedin.com/in/chunxi-tracy-guo/), a former Division 1 tennis student-athlete at Colorado States University who graduated June 2022.

My college athlete experience was invaluable to my personal development, and I was very inspired and motivated to help more tennis players around the world to experience the same. Therefore, my team and I have made a venture to connect athletes around the world: https://www.sportsconnect.info.

We managed to get in touch with a Malaysian tennis player whoâ€™s very interested in playing tennis and studying at UNIVERSITY_NAME. His name is PLAYER_NAME, 17 years old and is looking to apply to join a team for Fall 2023 (August).

His stats are as follows:
Stat one
Stat two

I have attached his college tennis recruiting video below for your perusal. We have met him in person and he is enthusiastic and exuberant! We are certain that he will give it his all should he end up joining your team.
 
Please do not hesitate to contact us should you have any questions!

Thanks and hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely
Tracy Guo,
